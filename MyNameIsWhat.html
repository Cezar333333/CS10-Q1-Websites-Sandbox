      <p>Hi, I am Cezar Pletea and I am from Romania, Europe. I am in 10th grade at <em><a href="https://queenelizabeth.epsb.ca/"> Queen Elizabeth highschool </a> </em>. My favorite subject is computer science and my favorite teacher is Mr. Mercer. I am dreaming about being one of the best programmer in the world. I have big inspirations for achieving this, such as like Steve Jobs, Steven Hawkins, Elon Musk and Bill gates for what they created and how they changed the world. Since I was a 6-year old child, I was so interested in apple and all the things that they achieved through the years that it made me dreaming about being an employer at Apple. But, in a few years, this will not be only a dream.</p>
      <article>
        <p>My biggest rolemodel and the one that made me love apple and that influenced my life in a good way is actually the inventor of the first iPhone ever made- Steve Jobs. </p>

      <h3>About Cezar</h3>

      <article>

        <p>My hobbies are playing soccer, editing images, creating designs for my clothing brand from Romania. I love discovering new things, learning new stuff and pushing my limits until they aren't my limit anymore. My favorite soccer player is Cristian Ronaldo. My favorite type of music is rap/r&b/old school rap. My favorites artists are Migos, Travis Scott, Sam Smith, The Weeknd and Pop Smoke.</p>

        <p>In Romania my parents used to tell me that we're going on a trip but they wouldn't tell me where we're going and i actually loved being surprised. My parents love and have hope in me that i will become exactly what i want to become. I will show them that i am the best at what i want to be. When I'll grow up and be rich, i will buy them everything they want, because that's what they did for me to make sure that i will achieve.</p>

        <p>I used to go out with my friends in Romania but here i don't have that many friends and most of my time i spent on my computer learning and sometimes watching series on <em><a href="https://www.netflix.com/ca/"> netflix </a></em>.
