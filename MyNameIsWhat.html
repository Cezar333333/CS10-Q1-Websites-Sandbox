      <h3>Who is Cezar</h3>

      <p>Hi, I am Cezar Pletea and I am from Romania, Europe. I am in 10th grade at <em><a href="https://queenelizabeth.epsb.ca/"> Queen Elizabeth highschool </a> </em>. My favorite subject is computer science and my favorite teacher is Mr. Mercer. I am dreaming about being one of the best programmer in the world. I have big inspirations for achieving this, such as like Steve Jobs, Steven Hawkins, Elon Musk and Bill gates for what they created and how they changed the world. Since I was a 6-year old child, I was so interested in apple and all the things that they achieved through the years that it made me dreaming about being an employer at Apple. But, in a few years, this will not be only a dream.</p>
      <article>
        <p>My biggest rolemodel and the one that made me love apple and that influenced my life in a good way is actually the inventor of the first iPhone ever made- <em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs"> Steve Jobs. </a> </em></p>

My favorite type of music is rap/r&b/old school rap. My favorites artists are Migos, Travis Scott, Sam Smith, The Weeknd and Pop Smoke.</p>

        <p>In Romania my parents used to tell me that we're going on a trip but they wouldn't tell me where we're going and i actually loved being surprised. My parents love and have hope in me that i will become exactly what i want to become. I will show them that i am the best at what i want to be. When I'll grow up and be rich, i will buy them everything they want, because that's what they did for me to make sure that i will achieve.</p>

        <p>I used to go out with my friends in Romania but here i don't have that many friends and most of my time i spent on my computer learning and sometimes watching series on <em><a href="https://www.netflix.com/ca/"> netflix </a></em>.
