      <h3>Other celebrations</h3>

        <article>
        <p>Other celebrations are saints celebrations, like Saint Constantin and Elena or Saint Maria, Jesus's mother. The people that are named like the saints are receiving a "Happy name-day" from everyone.</p>

            <p>During the Christmas Eve, family and friends come together,they bring presents and have a lot of fun talking and cheering Jesus's birthday. We always have a Christmas tree that is full of globes, lights and all those decorations.
            Easter's Eve is the day that the whole family comes together on the day that Jesus was sacrified on a crucifix. We have chocolate egg hunt and lots of good food.</p>
