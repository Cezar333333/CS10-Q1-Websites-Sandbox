I am 14 and a half years old and my dream is to become a professional in the computer and programming domain.I love having big dreams that no one’s going to stop me from achieving them. As you can see I am really motivated about my life goals and dreams. I want to be a big part of the future so that everyone would recognize me for what I have achieved enthuse years.

I have a lot of big inspirations in the IT and A.I world, like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking and I believe that I can be at the level that they are right now.

Since I was a 6-year old child, I was so interested in apple and all the things that they achieved through the years that it made me dreaming about being an employer at Apple. But, in a few years, this will not be only a dream.

My biggest mentor and the one that made me love apple and that influenced my life in a good way is actually the inventor of the first iPhone ever made- Steve Jobs

Steve Jobs Introducing The iPhone At MacWorld 2007 ...

Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, and put up for adoption. He was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. He attended Reed College in 1972 before dropping out that same year, and traveled through India in 1974 seeking enlightenment and studying Zen Buddhism. His declassified FBI report states that he used marijuana and LSD while he was in college, and once told a reporter that taking LSD was "one of the two or three most important things" he had done in his life.
Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics. Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985 after a long power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO John Sculley. That same year, Jobs took a few of Apple's members with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets. In addition, he helped to develop the visual effects industry when he funded the computer graphics division of George Lucas's Lucasfilm in 1986. The new company was Pixar, which produced the first 3D computer animated feature film Toy Story (1995).
